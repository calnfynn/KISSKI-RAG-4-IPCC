The costs of loss and damage, particularly from extreme events, can deplete national capital reserves (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Noy--2019\">Noy and Edmonds, 2019</a>). <a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Thomas--2017\">Thomas and Benjamin (2017)</a> show how loss and damage can lead to an \u2018unvirtuous cycle of climate-induced erosion of development and resilience\u2019. In this cycle, addressing loss and damage strains limited national resources, diverting public funding and other resources to address negative climate impacts. This in turn reduces resources and capacities which could be allocated to adaptation, building resilience and sustainable development, thereby increasing vulnerability to climate change and leading to further loss and damage where the cycle begins again. The cascading and cumulative impacts of extreme events experienced in Pacific and Caribbean SIDS exemplify that this cycle may already be in effect.</p><p class=\"Body_Box_blue_Box_body\" lang=\"en-GB\" id=\"box-15.2_p3\">In addition to the strain on national resources that loss and damage currently presents, credit ratings of SIDS have recently begun to include vulnerability to climate change, which may have negative impacts on their abilities to borrow external funds, attract foreign investment or access concessional financing (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Buhr--2018\">Buhr et al., 2018</a>; <a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Volz--2020\">Volz et al., 2020</a>).\n---\nIn many small islands, population is concentrated in the low-elevation coastal zone (LECZ), which is defined as coastal areas below 10-m elevation. Approximately 22 million in the Caribbean live below 6-m elevation (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Cashman--2017\">Cashman and Nagdee, 2017</a>) and an estimated 90% of Pacific Islanders live within 5 km of the coast, if Papua New Guinea is excluded (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Andrew--2019\">Andrew et al., 2019</a>). In the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, over 60% of the population lives within 1 km of the coast (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Andrew--2019\">Andrew et al., 2019</a>). Most Pacific islands have \u226550% of their infrastructure within 500 m of the coast (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Kumar--2015\">Kumar and Taylor, 2015</a>), and in Kiribati, Marshall Islands and Tuvalu, &gt;95% of the infrastructure is located in the LECZ (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Andrew--2019\">Andrew et al., 2019</a>) (Figure 15.3). Sustainable development challenges including insufficient land use planning and land use competition contribute to increased vulnerability of human settlements to climate change in small islands (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Kelman--2014\">Kelman, 2014</a>; Mycoo, 2021).</p><p class=\"Body_Body-justify\" lang=\"en-GB\" id=\"15.3.4.1_p3\">Categories 4 and 5 TCs are severely impacting settlements and infrastructure in small islands. TC Maria in 2017 destroyed nearly all of Dominica\u2019s infrastructure and losses per unit of GDP amounted to more than 225% of the annual GDP (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Eckstein--2018\">Eckstein et al., 2018</a>). Destruction from TC Winston in 2016 amounted to more than 20% of Fiji\u2019s current GDP (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Cox--2018\">Cox et al., 2018</a>). Additionally, living conditions in human settlements are changing due to storm surge which is already penetrating further inland compared with a few decades ago (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#IPCC--2018\">IPCC, 2018</a>, <a class=\"section-link\" data-title=\"Reversibility and Impacts of Temporary Overshoot of 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C Warming\" href=\"/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-3#3.4.4\">Section 3.4.4.3</a>; <a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Brown--2018\">Brown et al., 2018</a>).</p><p class=\"Body_Body-justify\" lang=\"en-GB\" id=\"15.3.4.1_p4\">A growing percentage of the population in small islands lives in informal settlements which occupy marginal lands leading to increased population exposure and vulnerability to climate-related hazards (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Mycoo--2017\">Mycoo and Donovan, 2017</a>). Unplanned settlements have compounded flooding brought on by slow-onset hazards such as coastal and riverine flooding and fast-onset events such as TCs and storm surges (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Butcher-Gollach--2015\">Butcher-Gollach, 2015</a>; <a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Chandra--2016\">Chandra and Gaganis, 2016</a>; <a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Mycoo--2017\">Mycoo, 2017</a>).", "reference_answer": "The effects are acute and multifaceted: Habitability is decreasing as key resources (freshwater, arable land, marine protein) become scarcer. Settlements and infrastructure are at growing risk, especially in low-elevation zones, due to sea-level rise, flooding, and storm surges. Health is threatened by water salinisation, food insecurity, disease outbreaks, heat stress, and mental health impacts from displacement and loss. Livelihoods such as fisheries, agriculture, and tourism are destabilised. Social and cultural impacts include loss of ancestral land, forced migration, and disruption of community structures."}
{"question": "Which islands are affected?", "generated_answer": "According to the text, some of the small islands that show a large anticipated decrease in maximum catch potential of fisheries by the end of the century (according to an RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenario) include:\n\n* Federated States of Micronesia\n* Kiribati\n* Nauru\n* Palau\n* Tokelau\n* Tuvalu\n* S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe\n\nAdditionally, the text mentions specific islands that have been affected by climate-related events, such as:\n\n* Jaluit Atoll, Marshall Islands (eroded by TC Ophelia)\n* Farquhar Atoll, Seychelles (eroded by Category 5 TC Fantala)\n* Fakarava Atoll, French Polynesia (affected by tropical depressions)\n* Saint-Martin/Sint Maarten and Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy (affected by 2017 hurricanes)\n\nPlease note that these are not the only islands affected by climate-related events, as the text does not provide an exhaustive list.", "retrieved_context": "However, reef island disappearance and reduction in land area was clearly observed in New Caledonia and the Solomon Islands, and was attributed to the synergistic interactions of gradual SLR with stronger trade winds causing higher sea levels and local tectonics in the Solomon Islands (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Albert--2016\">Albert et al., 2016</a>; <a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Garcin--2016\">Garcin et al., 2016</a>). Despite important knowledge gaps on coastal erosion in high tropical islands, recent studies confirmed increasing shoreline retreat and beach loss over the past decades, mainly due to TC and ETC waves and human disturbances (<span class=\"condensed_italic\" lang>high confidence</span>) (e.g., in the Caribbean region: Anguilla, Saint-Kitts, Nevis, Montserrat, Dominica and Grenada (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Cambers--2009\">Cambers, 2009</a>; <a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Reguero--2018\">Reguero et al., 2018</a>)), and Pacific (Hawaii (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Romine--2013\">Romine and Fletcher, 2013</a>); Tubuai, French Polynesia (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Salmon--2019\">Salmon et al., 2019</a>)) and Indian Oceans (Anjouan, Comoros (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Ratter--2016\">Ratter et al., 2016</a>).</p><p class=\"Body_Body-justify\" lang=\"en-GB\" id=\"15.3.3.1.2_p2\">Despite storm-induced erosion prevailing along some shoreline sections, recent studies reaffirmed the contribution of TC and ETC waves to coastal and reef island vertical building through massive reef-to-island sediment transfer <span class=\"condensed_italic\" lang> (high confidence</span>). For example, TC Ophelia (1958) and Category 5 TC Fantala (2016), which eroded the islands of Jaluit Atoll, Marshall Islands (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Ford--2016\">Ford and Kench, 2016</a>), and Farquhar Atoll, Seychelles (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Duvat--2017c\">Duvat et al., 2017c</a>), respectively, also contributed to island and beach expansion. Likewise, tropical depressions can have constructional effects, as reported on Fakarava Atoll, French Polynesia (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Duvat--2020b\">Duvat et al., 2020b</a>). On Saint-Martin/Sint Maarten and Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy, the 2017 hurricanes, which caused marked shoreline retreat at most beach sites, also enabled beach formation and beach ridge development along some natural coasts (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Duvat--2019a\">Duvat et al., 2019a>; <a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Pillet--2019\">Pillet et al., 2019</a>). Similarly, El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a were involved in rapid and highly contrasting shoreline changes (<span class=\"condensed_italic\" lang>high confidence</span>), including reef island accretion in the Ryukyu Islands, Japan (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Kayanne--2016\">Kayanne et al., 2016</a>), beach shifts on Maiana and Aranuka atolls, Kiribati (Rankey, 2011), and beach erosion on Hawaii, USA (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Barnard--2015\">Barnard et al., 2015</a>). These contrasting shoreline responses were, respectively, due to coral reef degradation from past bleaching events providing material to islands, wave directional shifts, and increased wave energy.\n---\nThe small islands that show the largest anticipated decrease in the maximum catch potential of fisheries by the end of the century (according to an RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenario) include the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Nauru, Palau, Tokelau, Tuvalu, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, whereas some other small islands such as Bermuda, Easter Island (Chile), and Pitcairn Islands (UK), might actually witness increases in fish catch potential (<span class=\"condensed_italic\" lang>medium confidence</span>) (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Cheung--2018\">Cheung et al., 2018</a>). <a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Monnereau--2017\">Monnereau et al. (2017)</a> showed that for the fisheries sector, small island states are generally more vulnerable to climate change impacts compared to continental least-developed countries or coastal states because of their increased reliance on fisheries, the exposure of coastal communities to potential climatic threats and their limited adaptive capacity.</p><p class=\"Body_Body-justify\" lang=\"en-GB\" id=\"15.3.4.4_p3\">Projected impacts of climate change on agriculture and fisheries pose serious threats to dependent human populations (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Ren--2018\">Ren et al., 2018</a>; <a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Hoegh-Guldberg--2019\">Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019</a>), making the risk caused to livelihoods a key risk in small islands (KR7 in Figure 15.5). On small islands, despite biophysical commonalities (e.g., size and isolation), differences in economic status and level of dependence on agriculture and fisheries produce dynamic climate impacts (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Balzan--2018\">Balzan et al., 2018</a>). Climate change is impacting agricultural production in small islands through slow-onset stressors such as rising average temperatures, shifting rainfall patterns, SLR and extreme events like TCs. For example, TC Pam, a Category 5 cyclone, devastated Vanuatu in 2015 and caused losses and damages to the agriculture sector valued at USD 56.5 million (64.1% of GDP) (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Nalau--2017\">Nalau et al., 2017</a>), and TC Winston in 2016 resulted in losses and damages in the agriculture sector in Fiji valued at USD 254.7 million (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Iese--2020\">Iese et al., 2020</a>). In 2017, total losses and damages associated with hurricane Maria (Category 5) amounted to 224% of Dominica\u2019s 2016 GDP (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Barclay--2019\">Barclay et al., 2019</a>). Losses and damages in agriculture often led to people eating imported processed foods affecting their diet and nutrition (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Haynes--2020\">Haynes et al., 2020</a>). Small islands communities are also witnessing the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on agricultural systems (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Hickey--2020\">Hickey and Unwin, 2020</a>). However, the limited diversity of agriculture production and reduced household incomes are contributing to low diet diversity (Iese et al., 2021b). <a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Bell--2015\">Bell and Taylor (2015)</a> assessed the effects of climate change on specific sectors of agriculture in the Pacific islands region and found that, by 2090, staple food crops of taro, sweet potato and rice are expected to suffer from moderate to high impact. Among export crops, coffee is expected to sustain the most significant impact due largely to increased temperatures in the highland areas of Papua New Guinea\u2014a high production area (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Bell--2016\">Bell et al., 2016</a>). Livestock is an important protein source in some small islands and is particularly vulnerable to changes in temperature through heat stress (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Bell--2015\">Bell and Taylor, 2015</a>; <a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Lallo--2018\">Lallo et al., 2018</a>).", "reference_answer": "Virtually all small islands in the tropics and subtropics are affected—including those in the Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Caribbean Sea, eastern Atlantic, and Mediterranean. Low-lying atoll nations such as the Maldives, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, Kiribati, and several Caribbean and Indian Ocean islands are among the most at risk, but even islands with higher elevation are vulnerable due to the concentration of population and infrastructure near coasts. The most severe habitat and population impacts are seen in the Caribbean, Sundaland, the Philippines, and Pacific atolls."}
