{"question": "Which islands are most affected by climate change?", "generated_answer": "Based on the provided text, the following islands are mentioned as being most affected by climate change:\n\n1. **Tuvalu**: The capital of Tuvalu is mentioned as being vulnerable to climate impacts, including changing precipitation patterns, ESLs, intense strong winds, warming sea surface temperature (SST), and ocean acidification.\n2. **Majuro, Marshall Islands**: Population growth has led to land reclamation and the building of coastal protection structures, which negatively impact coastal and marine ecosystems, including reefs and mangroves.\n3. **Tarawa, Kiribati**: Similar to Majuro, Tarawa has experienced population growth, leading to land reclamation and the building of coastal protection structures, which have negatively impacted coastal and marine ecosystems.\n4. **Maldives Islands**: The Maldives Islands have experienced major floods due to the combination of distant-source swells and high spring tides, as well as the settlement of reclaimed low-lying areas.\n5. **Fiji**: Fiji has experienced major floods, including the Category 5 TC Winston in 2016, which caused widespread damage and health risks.\n6. **Samoa**: Samoa has also experienced significant impacts from climate change, including threats to transport infrastructure.\n7. **Kiribati**: Kiribati has experienced widespread flooding due to distant TC Pam in 2015, which was attributed to the strong swell generated, the long duration of the event, and exceptionally high regional sea levels.\n8. **Tuamotu atolls, French Polynesia**: The 1996 and 2011 floods in the Tuamotu atolls were due to the combination of distant-source swells causing lagoon filling and the obstruction of inter-islet channels by human-built structures.\n9. **New Caledonia**: New Caledonia is projected to experience an increase in dengue fever cases due to an increasing abundance of mosquitoes and a larger geographic range.\n\nThese islands are mentioned as being particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and changes in temperature and precipitation patterns.", "retrieved_context": "[15.3.2_p2] Furthermore, these factors exacerbate climate change-induced problems such as coastal flooding and erosion faced by small islands. These impacts continue to worsen, putting small islands at increasingly higher risk to the impacts of climate change (Box 15.1). There are multiple stressors that affect the vulnerability of small islands to climate change (McNamara et al., 2019).\r\n[15.3.2_p3] The problems of increasing exposure and vulnerability are most clearly seen in atoll islands. For example, in the capital of Tuvalu, economic stressors, food-related stressors and overcrowding make the islands much more vulnerable to climate impacts including changing precipitation patterns, ESLs, intense strong winds, warming sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean acidification (McCubbin et al., 2015). Small islands, in trying to address the problem of limited land availability, put in place practices that lead to increasing exposure for island people. In Majuro, Marshall Islands (Ford, 2012), Tarawa, Kiribati (Biribo and Woodroffe, 2013; Duvat, 2013), and the Maldives Islands (Kench, 2012; Naylor, 2015; Duvat and Magnan, 2019b), population growth has led to land reclamation and the building of coastal protection structures, such as seawalls. Land reclamation and coastal protection structures negatively impact coastal and marine ecosystems, including reefs and mangroves, which compromise the protection services that they deliver to island communities through wave energy attenuation and sediment supply (Gracia et al., 2018; Curnick et al., 2019; Duvat and Magnan, 2019a) and may impact the long-term sustainable adaptive planning of islands (Giardino et al., 2018). In addition, these construction activities disrupt natural coastal processes, thereby causing coastal erosion, which in turn increases the risk of flooding (Yamano et al., 2007; Duvat et al., 2017b) (Figure 15.3). This becomes a vicious cycle, with more land reclamation necessary to accommodate growing populations. Land reclamation requires stabilisation by protection structures, which then contributes to environmental degradation that increases the exposure and vulnerability of the communities living in these atolls (Duvat et al., 2017b).\r\n[15.3.3.1.1_p1] Recent studies confirmed that observed ESL events causing extensive flooding generally resulted from compound effects, including the combination of SLR (Section 3.2.2.2 and Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3) with ETCs, TCs and tropical depressions (WGI AR6 Sections 11.7.1 and 11.7.2, Seneviratne, 2021), ENSO-related high-water levels associated with high or spring tide and/or local human disturbances amplifying impacts (high confidence). For example, the major floods that occurred in 1987 and 2007 in the Maldives involved the combination of distant-source swells and high spring tides and the settlement of reclaimed low-lying areas (Box 15.1; Wadey et al., 2017). In the Tuamotu atolls, French Polynesia, the 1996 and 2011 floods were due to the combination of distant-source swells causing lagoon filling and the obstruction of inter-islet channels by human-built structures (Canavesio, 2019). In 2011, the flooding of the lagoon-facing coast of Majuro Atoll, Marshall Islands, resulted from the combination of high sea levels occurring during La Ni\u00f1a conditions and seasonally high tides (Ford et al., 2018). Another example is the widespread flooding caused by distant TC Pam (2015) in Kiribati and Tuvalu, which was attributed to the strong swell generated, the long duration of the event and exceptionally high regional sea levels (Hoeke et al., 2021). On high tropical islands, major floods often occurred during TC events, due to the cumulative effects of storm surge and river flooding, the impacts of which were exacerbated by human-induced changes to natural processes in urban areas.\n---\nLucia, SLR and ESLs are projected to be key risks to transport infrastructure at 1.5\u00b0C unless further adaptation is undertaken (Monioudi et al., 2018). Similar findings were reported for Samoa (Fakhruddin et al., 2015). Even islands of higher elevation are expected to be threatened, given the high amount of infrastructure located near the coast, for example, Fiji (Kumar and Taylor, 2015).\r\n[15.3.4.2_p1] Small islands face disproportionate health risks associated with changes in temperature and precipitation, climate variability, and extremes (Cross-Chapter Box INTERREG in Chapter 16; KR4 in Section 15.3.9, Figure 15.5). Climate change is projected to increase the current burden of climate-related health risks (Weatherdon et al., 2016; Ebi et al., 2018; Schnitter et al., 2019). Health risks can arise from exposures to extreme weather and climate events, including heatwaves; changes in ecological systems associated with changing weather patterns that can result, for example, in more disease vectors, or in compromised safety and security of water and food; and exposures related to disruption of health systems, migration, and other factors (see Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2; McIver et al., 2016; Mycoo, 2018a; WHO, 2018).\r\n[15.3.4.2_p2] Extreme weather and climate events, particularly TCs, floods, drought, and heatwaves can cause injuries, infectious diseases, and deaths (Box 15.1; Sch\u00fctte et al., 2018). For example, Category 5 TC Winston hit Fiji on 20 February 2016. During the national state of emergency (7 March and 29 May 2016), the World Health Organization portable toolkit for an early warning alert and response system (EWARS in a Box) was deployed within 24 h; it recorded 34,113 cases of the nine syndromes among 326,861 consultations in a population of about 900,000; 48% of cases were influenza-like illnesses, 30% were acute watery diarrhoea, and 13% were suspected cases of dengue. There also were 583 cases of Zika-like illness (1.7% of all cases) and two large outbreaks of viral conjunctivitis (total of 880 cases). During TC Maria in Puerto Rico, there were more deaths per 100,000 among individuals living in municipalities with the lowest socioeconomic development and for men 65 years of age or older (Santos-Burgoa et al., 2018); this excess risk persisted for at least 1 year after the event. The first human cases of leptospirosis in the U.S. Virgin Islands occurred in 2017 after TC Irma and Maria. TCs also can affect treatment and care for people with non-communicable diseases, including exacerbation or complications of illness and premature death (Ryan et al., 2015).\r\n[15.3.4.2_p3] Heat-related mortality and risks of occupational heat stress in small island states are projected to increase with higher temperatures (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; Mendez-Lazaro et al., 2018). Higher temperatures can also affect the productivity of outdoor workers (Taylor et al., 2021). Climate change, urbanisation, and air pollution are risk factors for the rise of allergic diseases in Asia Pacific (Pawankar et al., 2020).\r\n[15.3.4.2_p4] Tropical and subtropical islands face risks from vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue fever, and the Zika virus. El Ni\u00f1o events can increase the risk of diseases such as Zika virus by increasing biting rates, decreasing mosquito mortality rates and shortening the time required for the virus to replicate within the mosquito (Caminade et al., 2017). By combining disease prediction models with climate indicators that are routinely monitored, alongside evaluation tools, it is possible to generate probabilistic dengue outlooks in the Caribbean and early warning systems (Oritz et al., 2015; Lowe et al., 2018). Projections suggest that more individuals will become at risk of dengue fever by the 2030s and beyond because of an increasing abundance of mosquitos and larger geographic range (Ebi et al., 2018). Projected increases in mean temperature could double the dengue burden in New Caledonia by 2100 (Teurlai et al., 2015).", "reference_answer": null}

{"question": "What is anthropogenic climate change?", "generated_answer": "Anthropogenic climate change refers to the changes in the Earth's climate that are caused by human activities. The term \"anthropogenic\" comes from the Greek words \"anthropos,\" meaning human, and \"genos,\" meaning origin or cause.\n\nHuman activities that contribute to climate change include:\n\n1. **Burning fossil fuels**: The release of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases from burning coal, oil, and gas for energy.\n2. **Deforestation**: The clearance of forests, mainly for agriculture and urbanization, which releases carbon stored in trees and reduces the ability of forests to act as carbon sinks.\n3. **Land use changes**: Changes in land use, such as the conversion of natural habitats to agricultural land or urban areas, which can lead to the release of stored carbon and reduce the ability of ecosystems to sequester carbon.\n4. **Methane emissions**: The release of methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas, from human activities such as agriculture, natural gas production and transport, and landfills.\n5. **Nitrous oxide emissions**: The release of nitrous oxide (N2O), a greenhouse gas, from human activities such as agriculture, industrial processes, and the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nThese human activities have led to an increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily CO2, which traps heat and leads to global warming. The consequences of climate change include:\n\n1. **Rising global temperatures**: The average global temperature has risen by about 1\u00b0C since the late 19th century.\n2. **More extreme weather events**: Climate change is linked to an increase in extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall.\n3. **Sea-level rise**: The melting of glaciers and ice sheets, and the expansion of seawater as it warms, are causing sea levels to rise.\n4. **Changes in precipitation patterns**: Climate change is altering the patterns of rainfall and snowfall around the world, leading to droughts in some areas and floods in others.\n5. **Impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity**: Climate change is altering the distribution and abundance of plants and animals, and leading to the loss of biodiversity.\n\nTo mitigate the effects of climate change, it's essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy. This can be achieved through a range of measures, including:\n\n1. **Transitioning to renewable energy sources**: Such as solar and wind power.\n2. **Increasing energy efficiency**: Improving the efficiency of buildings, transportation, and industry.\n3. **Electrifying transportation**: Promoting the adoption of electric vehicles.\n4. **Carbon capture and storage**: Implementing technologies to capture and store CO2 emissions from power plants and industrial processes.\n5. **Protecting and restoring natural carbon sinks**: Preserving and expanding forests, wetlands, and other ecosystems that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere.\n\nBy taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change, we can mitigate its effects and create a more sustainable future for all.", "retrieved_context": "J.

{"question": "What is anthropogenic climate change?", "generated_answer": "Anthropogenic climate change refers to the changes in the Earth's climate that are caused by human activities. The term \"anthropogenic\" comes from the Greek words \"anthropos,\" meaning human, and \"genos,\" meaning produced or caused by.\n\nHuman activities that contribute to climate change include:\n\n1. Burning fossil fuels: The burning of coal, oil, and gas for energy releases carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to a trap of heat and a rise in global temperatures.\n2. Deforestation: The clearing of forests for agriculture, urbanization, and other purposes releases carbon stored in trees and reduces the ability of forests to act as carbon sinks.\n3. Land use changes: Changes in land use, such as the conversion of natural habitats to agricultural land or urban areas, can lead to the release of stored carbon and reduce the ability of ecosystems to sequester carbon.\n4. Industrial processes: The production of cement, steel, and other industrial processes also release large amounts of greenhouse gases.\n5. Agriculture: The production of meat, especially beef, and other animal products leads to the release of methane and other greenhouse gases.\n\nThese human activities have led to an increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which in turn has caused the Earth's average temperature to rise by about 1\u00b0C since the late 19th century. This warming is causing a range of impacts, including:\n\n* Rising sea levels\n* More frequent and intense heatwaves\n* Changes in precipitation patterns\n* Increased risk of droughts and floods\n* Loss of biodiversity\n* Negative impacts on human health and well-being\n\nThe references you provided earlier are related to the impacts of climate change, including the effects on biodiversity, human health, and the economy. They highlight the need for urgent action to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts.\n\nIn the context of the references you provided, anthropogenic climate change is a key theme that is explored in many of the studies. For example, the study by Warren et al. (2018a) examines the projected effects of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C rather than 2\u00b0C on insects, vertebrates, and plants, while the study by Watts et al.

An IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty[Masson-Delmotte, V., P. Zhai, H.-O. P\u00f6rtner, D. Roberts, J. Skea, P.R.\n---\nThere is clear evidence of very high risk at 3\u00b0C global warming for wildfires, marine heatwaves and heatwaves in megacities (the latter being set at 2.7\u00b0C).\r\n[16.6.3.2_p12] Based on the available evidence, we assess that there is medium confidence that the transition to very high risk would happen at a median value 2\u00b0C of global warming, considering the increased risk for breadbasket failure and irreversible impacts associated with changes in extremes at this warming level (e.g., damages to ecosystems, health impacts, severe coastal storms), but that due to the disproportionate increases in risk between 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C this transition begins already at 1.8\u00b0C. The higher range for this transition is set with medium confidence at 2.5\u00b0C in this low/no adaptation scenario, owing to the further projected nonlinear increases in risks associated with high temperature events above 2\u00b0C (WGI AR6 Figure SPM.6, IPCC, 2021; Cross-Chapter Box 12.1, Ranasinghe et al., 2021), and also the limits to adaptation associated with dealing with a rapid escalation of extreme weather events globally during this century; extreme events are particularly difficult to adapt to and thus more often exceed hard limits to adaptation, particularly in natural ecosystem settings (Section 16.4).\r\n[16.6.3.3_p1] RFC3 reflects how key risks are distributed unevenly across regions and different population groups, due to the non-uniform spatial distributions of physical climate change hazards, exposure and vulnerability across regions. It addresses how risks disproportionately affect particularly vulnerable societies and socio-ecological systems, including disadvantaged people and communities in countries at all levels of development. AR5 concluded that low-latitude and less developed areas generally face greater risk than higher-latitude and more developed countries, including for food- and health-related risks. This conclusion remains valid and is now supported by greater evidence across a range of sectors and geographic regions.\r\n[16.6.3.3_p2] Note that the assessment here is largely based on the national and regional distribution of impacts, rather than sub-national distribution or explicit consideration of vulnerable elements of society. Climate risks are also strongly related to inequalities, often but not always intersecting with poverty (Section 16.1), geographic location, and political and socio-cultural aspects. Thus, countries with high inequality tend to be more vulnerable, and more exposed, to climate hazards (Section 16.1). While the literature assessed here tends to be insufficiently granular to resolve local inequalities, it does confirm the AR5 finding that low-latitude and less developed areas generally face greater risk.\r\n[16.6.3.3_p3] AR6 continues to highlight the uneven regional distribution of projected climate change risks. Biodiversity loss is projected to affect a greater number of regions with increasing warming, and to be highest in northern South America, southern Africa, most of Australia, and northern high latitudes (Section 2.5.1.3, medium confidence). Climate change is projected to increase the number of people at risk of hunger in mid-century, concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Central America (Chapter 5, high confidence), increasing undernutrition, stunting and related childhood mortality particularly in Africa and Asia  and disproportionately affecting children and pregnant women (Chapter 7, high confidence), strongly mediated by socioeconomic factors (Sections 7.2.4.4, 7.3.1, very high confidence). Strong geographical differences in heat-related mortality are projected to emerge later this century, mainly driven by growth in regions with tropical and subtropical climates (Section 7.3.1, very high confidence).\r\n[16.6.3.3_p4] In AR5 and SR15, the transition from undetectable to moderate risk was located below what were at the time \u2018recent\u2019 temperatures of between 0.5\u00b0C and 0.8\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, with medium to high confidence, based on evidence of distributional impacts on crop production and water resources. New literature has continued to confirm this transition has already taken place, including more recent observed impacts for regions and groups within the food and water sectors, strongly linked to Representative Key Risks for health, water and food security (Sections 16.2, 16.5, 5.4.1, 5.5.1, 5.8.1, 5.12; Chapter 7).\r\n[16.6.3.3_p5] In AR6, moderate risks have already been assessed to have occurred in Africa for economic growth and reduced inequality, biodiversity and ecosystems, mortality and morbidity due to heat extremes and infectious disease, and food production in fisheries and crop production (Figure 9.6).", "reference_answer": null}
