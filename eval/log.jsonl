{"question": "Which islands are most affected by climate change?", "generated_answer": "Based on the provided text, the following islands are mentioned as being most affected by climate change:\n\n1. **Tuvalu**: The capital of Tuvalu is mentioned as being vulnerable to climate impacts, including changing precipitation patterns, ESLs, intense strong winds, warming sea surface temperature (SST), and ocean acidification.\n2. **Majuro, Marshall Islands**: Population growth has led to land reclamation and the building of coastal protection structures, which negatively impact coastal and marine ecosystems, including reefs and mangroves.\n3. **Tarawa, Kiribati**: Similar to Majuro, Tarawa has experienced population growth, leading to land reclamation and the building of coastal protection structures, which have negatively impacted coastal and marine ecosystems.\n4. **Maldives Islands**: The Maldives Islands have experienced major floods due to the combination of distant-source swells and high spring tides, as well as the settlement of reclaimed low-lying areas.\n5. **Fiji**: Fiji has experienced major floods, including the Category 5 TC Winston in 2016, which caused widespread damage and health risks.\n6. **Samoa**: Samoa has also experienced significant impacts from climate change, including threats to transport infrastructure.\n7. **Kiribati**: Kiribati has experienced widespread flooding due to distant TC Pam in 2015, which was attributed to the strong swell generated, the long duration of the event, and exceptionally high regional sea levels.\n8. **Tuamotu atolls, French Polynesia**: The 1996 and 2011 floods in the Tuamotu atolls were due to the combination of distant-source swells causing lagoon filling and the obstruction of inter-islet channels by human-built structures.\n9. **New Caledonia**: New Caledonia is projected to experience an increase in dengue fever cases due to an increasing abundance of mosquitoes and a larger geographic range.\n\nThese islands are mentioned as being particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and changes in temperature and precipitation patterns.", "retrieved_context": "[15.3.2_p2] Furthermore, these factors exacerbate climate change-induced problems such as coastal flooding and erosion faced by small islands. These impacts continue to worsen, putting small islands at increasingly higher risk to the impacts of climate change (Box 15.1). There are multiple stressors that affect the vulnerability of small islands to climate change (McNamara et al., 2019).\r\n[15.3.2_p3] The problems of increasing exposure and vulnerability are most clearly seen in atoll islands. For example, in the capital of Tuvalu, economic stressors, food-related stressors and overcrowding make the islands much more vulnerable to climate impacts including changing precipitation patterns, ESLs, intense strong winds, warming sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean acidification (McCubbin et al., 2015). Small islands, in trying to address the problem of limited land availability, put in place practices that lead to increasing exposure for island people. In Majuro, Marshall Islands (Ford, 2012), Tarawa, Kiribati (Biribo and Woodroffe, 2013; Duvat, 2013), and the Maldives Islands (Kench, 2012; Naylor, 2015; Duvat and Magnan, 2019b), population growth has led to land reclamation and the building of coastal protection structures, such as seawalls. Land reclamation and coastal protection structures negatively impact coastal and marine ecosystems, including reefs and mangroves, which compromise the protection services that they deliver to island communities through wave energy attenuation and sediment supply (Gracia et al., 2018; Curnick et al., 2019; Duvat and Magnan, 2019a) and may impact the long-term sustainable adaptive planning of islands (Giardino et al., 2018). In addition, these construction activities disrupt natural coastal processes, thereby causing coastal erosion, which in turn increases the risk of flooding (Yamano et al., 2007; Duvat et al., 2017b) (Figure 15.3). This becomes a vicious cycle, with more land reclamation necessary to accommodate growing populations. Land reclamation requires stabilisation by protection structures, which then contributes to environmental degradation that increases the exposure and vulnerability of the communities living in these atolls (Duvat et al., 2017b).\r\n[15.3.3.1.1_p1] Recent studies confirmed that observed ESL events causing extensive flooding generally resulted from compound effects, including the combination of SLR (Section 3.2.2.2 and Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3) with ETCs, TCs and tropical depressions (WGI AR6 Sections 11.7.1 and 11.7.2, Seneviratne, 2021), ENSO-related high-water levels associated with high or spring tide and/or local human disturbances amplifying impacts (high confidence). For example, the major floods that occurred in 1987 and 2007 in the Maldives involved the combination of distant-source swells and high spring tides and the settlement of reclaimed low-lying areas (Box 15.1; Wadey et al., 2017). In the Tuamotu atolls, French Polynesia, the 1996 and 2011 floods were due to the combination of distant-source swells causing lagoon filling and the obstruction of inter-islet channels by human-built structures (Canavesio, 2019). In 2011, the flooding of the lagoon-facing coast of Majuro Atoll, Marshall Islands, resulted from the combination of high sea levels occurring during La Ni\u00f1a conditions and seasonally high tides (Ford et al., 2018). Another example is the widespread flooding caused by distant TC Pam (2015) in Kiribati and Tuvalu, which was attributed to the strong swell generated, the long duration of the event and exceptionally high regional sea levels (Hoeke et al., 2021). On high tropical islands, major floods often occurred during TC events, due to the cumulative effects of storm surge and river flooding, the impacts of which were exacerbated by human-induced changes to natural processes in urban areas.\n---\nLucia, SLR and ESLs are projected to be key risks to transport infrastructure at 1.5\u00b0C unless further adaptation is undertaken (Monioudi et al., 2018). Similar findings were reported for Samoa (Fakhruddin et al., 2015). Even islands of higher elevation are expected to be threatened, given the high amount of infrastructure located near the coast, for example, Fiji (Kumar and Taylor, 2015).\r\n[15.3.4.2_p1] Small islands face disproportionate health risks associated with changes in temperature and precipitation, climate variability, and extremes (Cross-Chapter Box INTERREG in Chapter 16; KR4 in Section 15.3.9, Figure 15.5). Climate change is projected to increase the current burden of climate-related health risks (Weatherdon et al., 2016; Ebi et al., 2018; Schnitter et al., 2019). Health risks can arise from exposures to extreme weather and climate events, including heatwaves; changes in ecological systems associated with changing weather patterns that can result, for example, in more disease vectors, or in compromised safety and security of water and food; and exposures related to disruption of health systems, migration, and other factors (see Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2; McIver et al., 2016; Mycoo, 2018a; WHO, 2018).\r\n[15.3.4.2_p2] Extreme weather and climate events, particularly TCs, floods, drought, and heatwaves can cause injuries, infectious diseases, and deaths (Box 15.1; Sch\u00fctte et al., 2018). For example, Category 5 TC Winston hit Fiji on 20 February 2016. During the national state of emergency (7 March and 29 May 2016), the World Health Organization portable toolkit for an early warning alert and response system (EWARS in a Box) was deployed within 24 h; it recorded 34,113 cases of the nine syndromes among 326,861 consultations in a population of about 900,000; 48% of cases were influenza-like illnesses, 30% were acute watery diarrhoea, and 13% were suspected cases of dengue. There also were 583 cases of Zika-like illness (1.7% of all cases) and two large outbreaks of viral conjunctivitis (total of 880 cases). During TC Maria in Puerto Rico, there were more deaths per 100,000 among individuals living in municipalities with the lowest socioeconomic development and for men 65 years of age or older (Santos-Burgoa et al., 2018); this excess risk persisted for at least 1 year after the event. The first human cases of leptospirosis in the U.S. Virgin Islands occurred in 2017 after TC Irma and Maria. TCs also can affect treatment and care for people with non-communicable diseases, including exacerbation or complications of illness and premature death (Ryan et al., 2015).\r\n[15.3.4.2_p3] Heat-related mortality and risks of occupational heat stress in small island states are projected to increase with higher temperatures (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; Mendez-Lazaro et al., 2018). Higher temperatures can also affect the productivity of outdoor workers (Taylor et al., 2021). Climate change, urbanisation, and air pollution are risk factors for the rise of allergic diseases in Asia Pacific (Pawankar et al., 2020).\r\n[15.3.4.2_p4] Tropical and subtropical islands face risks from vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue fever, and the Zika virus. El Ni\u00f1o events can increase the risk of diseases such as Zika virus by increasing biting rates, decreasing mosquito mortality rates and shortening the time required for the virus to replicate within the mosquito (Caminade et al., 2017). By combining disease prediction models with climate indicators that are routinely monitored, alongside evaluation tools, it is possible to generate probabilistic dengue outlooks in the Caribbean and early warning systems (Oritz et al., 2015; Lowe et al., 2018). Projections suggest that more individuals will become at risk of dengue fever by the 2030s and beyond because of an increasing abundance of mosquitos and larger geographic range (Ebi et al., 2018). Projected increases in mean temperature could double the dengue burden in New Caledonia by 2100 (Teurlai et al., 2015).", "reference_answer": null}

Groundwater and estuaries are becoming saltier, with saline conditions persisting for months after events, making drinking and irrigation water less available. The key impact is the rising salinity of island freshwater supplies due to marine intrusion and sea-level rise.\"}\n{\"question\": \"Are fishing ventures influenced by the changes?\", \"generated_answer\": \"Yes, fishing ventures are indeed influenced by the changing climate conditions.\\n\\nI'm taking information from paragraphs 1 and 6 to answer this question.
