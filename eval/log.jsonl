For example, TC Ophelia (1958) and Category 5 TC Fantala (2016), which eroded the islands of Jaluit Atoll, Marshall Islands (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Ford--2016\">Ford and Kench, 2016</a>), and Farquhar Atoll, Seychelles (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Duvat--2017c\">Duvat et al., 2017c</a>), respectively, also contributed to island and beach expansion.

On Saint-Martin/Sint Maarten and Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy, the 2017 hurricanes, which caused marked shoreline retreat at most beach sites, also enabled beach formation and beach ridge development along some natural coasts (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Duvat--2019a\">Duvat et al., 2019a</a>; <a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Pillet--2019\">Pillet et al., 2019</a>).

These contrasting shoreline responses were, respectively, due to coral reef degradation from past bleaching events providing material to islands, wave directional shifts, and increased wave energy.\n---\nThe small islands that show the largest anticipated decrease in the maximum catch potential of fisheries by the end of the century (according to an RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenario) include the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Nauru, Palau, Tokelau, Tuvalu, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, whereas some other small islands such as Bermuda, Easter Island (Chile), and Pitcairn Islands (UK), might actually witness increases in fish catch potential (<span class=\"condensed_italic\" lang>medium confidence</span>) (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Cheung--2018\">Cheung et al., 2018</a>). <a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Monnereau--2017\">Monnereau et al.

Climate change is impacting agricultural production in small islands through slow-onset stressors such as rising average temperatures, shifting rainfall patterns, SLR and extreme events like TCs. For example, TC Pam, a Category 5 cyclone, devastated Vanuatu in 2015 and caused losses and damages to the agriculture sector valued at USD 56.5 million (64.1% of GDP) (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Nalau--2017\">Nalau et al., 2017</a>), and TC Winston in 2016 resulted in losses and damages in the agriculture sector in Fiji valued at USD 254.7 million (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Iese--2020\">Iese et al., 2020</a>).

Losses and damages in agriculture often led to people eating imported processed foods affecting their diet and nutrition (<a class=\"reference-link\" href=\"#Haynes--2020\">Haynes et al., 2020</a>).
